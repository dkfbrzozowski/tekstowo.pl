		<p>Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind<br>
		Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind<br>
		Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying<br><br>
		But I'm only human after all<br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		Don't put your blame on me<br>
		Don't put your blame on me<br><br>
		Take a look in the mirror, what do you see?<br>
		You do see it clearer or are you deceived?<br>
		In what you believe?<br><br>
		'Cause I'm only human after all<br>
		You're only human after all<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br>
		Don't put your blame on me<br>
		Some people got the real problems<br><br>
		Some people out of luck<br>
		Some people think I can solve them<br>
		Lord, heavens above<br><br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br><br>
		Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie<br>
		Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry<br>
		For making you cry<br><br>
		'Cause I'm only human after all<br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		Don't put your blame on me<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br><br>
		Some people got the real problems<br>
		Some people out of luck<br>
		Some people think I can solve them<br>
		Lord, heavens above<br><br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br><br>
		I'm only human, I make mistakes<br>
		I'm only human, that's all it takes<br>
		To put the blame on me, don't put the blame on me<br><br>
		'Cause I'm no prophet or messiah<br>
		You should go looking somewhere higher<br><br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		I'm only human after all<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br><br>
		I'm only human, I do what I can<br>
		I'm just a man, I do what I can<br>
		Don't put the blame on me<br>
		Don't put your blame on me<br><br>
