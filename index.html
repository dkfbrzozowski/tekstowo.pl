		<p>Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
			Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
			Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying<br>
			But I'm only human after all
			I'm only human after all
			Don't put your blame on me
			Don't put your blame on me<br>
			Take a look in the mirror, what do you see?
			You do see it clearer or are you deceived?
			In what you believe?<br>
			'Cause I'm only human after all
			You're only human after all
			Don't put the blame on me
			Don't put your blame on me
			Some people got the real problems<br>
			Some people out of luck
			Some people think I can solve them
			Lord, heavens above<br>
			I'm only human after all
			I'm only human after all
			Don't put the blame on me
			Don't put the blame on me<br>
			Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
			Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
			For making you cry<br>
			'Cause I'm only human after all
			I'm only human after all
			Don't put your blame on me
			Don't put the blame on me<br>
			Some people got the real problems
			Some people out of luck
			Some people think I can solve them
			Lord, heavens above<br></p>
